The objective of this code is to develop an Artificial Neural Network for analysis of Neutron Activation Analysis data.
This has been developed in 2022 for one simple specific case, as a proof of concept. A scientific paper is in preparation where full details will be given.
This contains two sets of code:
- A set of fortran routines for data augmentation
- A jupyter notebook for the ANN. It uses Pandas, Numpy and Tensorflow libraries

The data and the results obtained for the specific case are also provided.
